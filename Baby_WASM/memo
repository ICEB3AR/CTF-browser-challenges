make view with memory.buffer
and shrink some byte.
than memory.buffer will reallocate and free previous one.
but we have view. so we can access that chunk.
so make chunk size to 0x70 (shrink(65536-0x60)) and free (shrink(1) etc..).
make view with freed pointer(view = new DataView(memory.buffer)).
access freed chunk with view.
so overwrite fd and make another 0x70 chunk, we can allocate chunk averyware.
attack __free_hook or __malloc_hook.
